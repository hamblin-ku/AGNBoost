# AGNBoost

**A powerful machine learning toolkit for astronomical data analysis using advanced XGBoost techniques.**

---

## Overview

AGNBoost is a specialized Python framework designed for astronomers working with photometric data. Built on the foundation of [XGBoostLSS](https://statmixedml.github.io/XGBoostLSS/), AGNBoost provides a streamlined workflow for disitrubtional regression with photometric data, with particular focus on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) identification and galaxy property estimation.

## Installation

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. AGNBoost works best with Python 3.10/3.11 or later.

### Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n agnboost python=3.11
conda activate agnboost

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agnboost.git
cd agnboost

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Using pip and venv

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv agnboost-env
source agnboost-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: agnboost-env\Scripts\activate

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agnboost.git
cd agnboost
pip install -e .
```

### Verify Installation

```python
import agnboost
from agnboost import Catalog, AGNBoost

print(f"AGNBoost version: {agnboost.__version__}")
```

!!! note "Development Installation"
    The `-e` flag installs AGNBoost in "editable" mode, which means changes to the source code will be immediately available without reinstalling. This is particularly useful if you plan to contribute to the project or customize it for your research.

## Built on XGBoostLSS

AGNBoost leverages the power of [XGBoostLSS](https://statmixedml.github.io/XGBoostLSS/), a cutting-edge extension of XGBoost that enables **distributional modeling**. Instead of predicting single point estimates, XGBoostLSS models the entire conditioan distributions, providing:

- **Full Distributional Predictions**: Estimate not just the mean, but the entire shape of the target distribution
- **Robust Uncertainty Quantification**: Get principled uncertainty estimates for your astronomical measurements  
- **Flexible Distributions**: Choose from a wide variety of probability distributions tailored to your data
- **Advanced Regularization**: Built-in techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization

This makes AGNBoost particularly powerful for astronomical applications where uncertainty quantification is crucial, such as:

- Photometric redshift estimation with confidence intervals
- AGN identification with uncertainty bounds
- Stellar mass estimation with full posterior distributions
