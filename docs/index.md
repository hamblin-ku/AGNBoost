# AGNBoost

**A powerful machine learning toolkit for astronomical data analysis using advanced XGBoost techniques.**

---

## Overview

AGNBoost is a specialized Python framework designed for astronomers working with photometric data. Built on the foundation of [XGBoostLSS](https://statmixedml.github.io/XGBoostLSS/), AGNBoost provides a streamlined workflow for disitrubtional regression with photometric data, with particular focus on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) identification and galaxy property estimation.

## Installation

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. AGNBoost works best with Python 3.10/3.11 or later.

### Using Virtual Conda Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create and activate a conda environment
conda create -n agnboost python=3.11
conda activate agnboost

pip install git+https://github.com/hamblin-ku/AGNBoost.git
```

Otherwise, you can jsut install with pip (python 3.10 or later):

### Quick Install
To directly install the latest development version with pip, please use:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/hamblin-ku/AGNBoost.git
```

### Verify Installation

```python
import agnboost
from agnboost import Catalog, AGNBoost

print(f"AGNBoost version: {agnboost.__version__}")
```

## Built on XGBoostLSS

AGNBoost leverages the power of [XGBoostLSS](https://statmixedml.github.io/XGBoostLSS/), a cutting-edge extension of XGBoost that enables **distributional modeling**. Instead of predicting single point estimates, XGBoostLSS models the entire conditioan distributions, providing:

- **Full Distributional Predictions**: Estimate not just the mean, but the entire shape of the target distribution
- **Robust Uncertainty Quantification**: Get principled uncertainty estimates for your astronomical measurements  
- **Flexible Distributions**: Choose from a wide variety of probability distributions tailored to your data
- **Advanced Regularization**: Built-in techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization

This makes AGNBoost particularly powerful for astronomical applications where uncertainty quantification is crucial, such as:

- Photometric redshift estimation with confidence intervals
- AGN identification with uncertainty bounds
- Stellar mass estimation with full posterior distributions
