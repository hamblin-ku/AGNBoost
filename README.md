AGNBoost utilizes XGBoostLSS models to estimate fagn, the fraction of 3-30 micron light attributable to an AGN, and photometric redshift. It is trained on log10(N) = 7 mock galaxies from CIGALE, and uses 7 NIRCam+MIRI bands, 55 derived colors, and the squares of those derived colors as input features. AGNBoost provides a computationally fast and flexibile altnerative to color selection and SED fitting.
